## 🎯 **Project Status: Active Development**

- ✅ **Planning Phase Complete**: All business requirements, technical architecture, and development planning finished
- 🚀 **Development In Progress**: Foundation established, authentication system implemented
- 📋 **Progress**: 1/46 MVP issues completed, test coverage expansion underway
- 🧪 **Current Focus**: Expanding test coverage and implementing core character management

---

## 🏗️ **Purpose & Problem Statement**

### **The Problem**

Dungeon Masters need efficient tools to manage complex D&D 5e combat encounters, but existing solutions are either:

- **Too complex**: Virtual tabletops with steep learning curves
- **Too simple**: Basic initiative trackers missing critical features
- **Outdated**: Poor mobile support and dated user interfaces
- **Missing features**: No support for lair actions (unique to this tracker)

### **Our Solution**

A modern, purpose-built encounter tracker that:

- Focuses specifically on combat management (not trying to be everything)
- Provides intuitive UI/UX optimized for both desktop and mobile DMs
- Includes unique features like lair action support at initiative count 20
- Offers a sustainable freemium model accessible to all DM experience levels
